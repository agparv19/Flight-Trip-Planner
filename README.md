Flight Trip Planner: Find your optimal trip!

This project implements a rudimentary flight trip planner. Given a set of airports and flight with their connecting time and prices, a user might ask for an optimal sequence of flights for a journey.
Finding optimal trip on the basis of minimum time taken or minimum cost is supported.

`Flight Trip Planner.pdf` describes the problem statement, input, and expected outputs.

`data_and_queries.txt` is a sample input file. `result.txt` is the corresponding output.

`checker.cpp` can be used to test an input file.
